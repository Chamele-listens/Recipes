            <li>⅓ cup water</li>
            <li>630 grams bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp dry yeast</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan whisk together ⅓ cup of the milk, water, 
            and 30 grams of the bread flour (¼ cup). 
            Cook and stir over medium until paste consistency.
            Remove from heat and cool 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl stir together 300 grams of the flour (2½ cups) and the yeast.
            In a medium saucepan combine the remaining 1 cup milk, butter, sugar, and salt.
            Cook and stir over medium until warm (120°F to 130°F) and butter almost melts.
            Stir milk mixture, cooled paste, and eggs into flour mixture.
            Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can. </li>
        <li> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
            Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a dough that is smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky (3 to 5 minutes total). 
            Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning to grease surface of the dough. 
            Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (1 hour).</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.
            Cover; let rest 10 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, lightly grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans. </li>
        <li>Gently pat and pinch each dough half into a loaf shape, tucking edges underneath. </li>
        <li>Place shaped dough halves, seam sides down, in prepared loaf pans. 
            Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly double in size (30 minutes). 
            Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li> Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until bread sounds hollow when lightly tapped 
            (if necessary to prevent over browning, cover loosely with foil for the 
            last 5 to 10 minutes). 
            Immediately remove from pans; cool on wire racks. </li>
