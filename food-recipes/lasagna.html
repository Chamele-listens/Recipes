        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 15-ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly grated pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 pound mozzarella, grated</li>
            <li>16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1½ hours.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, pecorino Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. 
            Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan.
            Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. 
            Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce.
            Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top.
            Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
